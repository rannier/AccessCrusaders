# Use Case Story for Focused Finance


#### In a world of information overload, a customer who is impaired with ADHD is faced with the increasingly difficult task of maintaining their focus, particularly when it comes to complex issues such as managing finances.  
#### When using financial tools, they are bombarded with varying page layouts depending on which financial institution, with different ways to navigate while being hit with various regulatory disclosures.  For a person for this neurodivergence, this can become quickly overwhelming.
#### The size of this demographic is roughly 4.4% of the population, which accounts for 14.5 million people in the USA.  Furthermore, ADHD often goes undetected and undiagnosed, so this number could be significantly under-representing the need for solutions for ADHD customers, who may simply give up or have a bad experience when using financial tools.

#### Our specific case is an ADHD customer who is managing their monthly expenses with the intent to decide when they're moving savings to checking and vice versa.  This user typically wants to quickly view their financial transactions, understand how much money they have that is discretionary, and quickly make decisions before becoming overwhelmed and distracted by other elements of their bankâ€™s portal.
